/**

/** All time settings here are SECONDS */

/**
 * Minimum Distance between Mapper reports.
 *
 * This is your MAIN knob to turn for more/fewer uplink packets.
 * SMALLER distance: More packets, more dots on the map, more DC spent, more
 *                   power consumed (If you set this to a very small value, it
 *                   will still be rate-limited by how often your Region allows
 *                   back-to-back Uplink packets.)
 * LARGER distance: Fewer packets, might miss some hexes, conserves DC, battery
 *                  might last longer Note that a hex is about 340m across.
 *
 * Ideally, you want at least two uplinks in each hex to map it.
 */

/**
 * Minimum distance in meters from the last sent location before we send again.
 */
#define MIN_DIST 70.0

/**
 * If we are not moving at least MIN_DIST meters away from the last uplink,
 * when should we send a redundant Mapper Uplink from the same location?
 *
 * This Heartbeat or ping isn't all that important for mapping, but might be
 * useful for time-at-location tracking or other monitoring.
 * You can safely set this value very high.
 */

/**
 * Send one uplink at least once every N seconds
 */
#define STATIONARY_TX_INTERVAL (5 * 60)

/**
 * Change to 1 if you want to always send at THIS rate, with no slowing or sleeping.
 */

/**
 * This last stage is a low-power sleep to conserve battery when the Mapper has
 * not moved for a long time.
 *
 * This one is a difficult compromise:
 *
 *     Waking up to boot & power on the GPS is not a fast operation, so we want
 *     to avoid it as much as possible. There is no other motion sensor, so if
 *     we make it too long, we miss the first minutes of each motion while
 *     sleeping.
 *
 * Note that USB Power will prevent this low-power sleep, and also wake us up
 * from it.
 * A button press will also wake from sleep, but takes some time to initialise
 * and re-acquire.
